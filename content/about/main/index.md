  "Did you know that around 99% of all data was produced in the last 10 years? 

If you feel like you are drowning in data, you are not alone: **93% of people** surveyed by Oracle felt overwhelmed by data in their work! Spending time feeling overwhelmed leads to time wasted that could be spent carrying out interesting analysis and gaining important insights. When faced with these issues, many analysts opt to play it safe, sticking to the same tired summary statistics, missing opportunities within their data.

The amount of data being produced is not slowing down, so it is important to recognise the steps needed to reduce the effects of data overload. Taking a step back to clearly define the problems you are aiming to solve, or the insights you are hoping to gain with the data is a simple, often overlooked part of the analysis process. From this, crafting a statistical analysis plan that includes the most effective approaches to solve this problem, whilst working within the limitations of the data, will help add direction to the process. 

S-Cubed is here to work through the data fatigue with you, helping you to streamline this process, saving time and stress by:

- Designing a robust statistical analysis plan working towards your projectâ€™s goals, identifying the most appropriate statistical methods for the job
- Translating even the most complex analysis results into meaningful insights that can be communicated with a non-technical audience
- Identifying ways in which this process can be streamlined in future, reducing the chance of suffering data fatigue in future

If you would like to hear how S-Cubed can translate your data into results, book a [free 30 minute discovery call](https://calendly.com/sophie-a-lee10/30min)."
