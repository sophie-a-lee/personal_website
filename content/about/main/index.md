  "Hello! I am Dr. Sophie Lee, the founder and director of S-cubed. 
  
  I am a statistician that loves teaching people and showing that statistics does not need to be scary! Over the past 10 years, I have written and delivered [statistics and R programming courses](/courses) to people from many different backgrounds and levels of experience. Some of the groups I have delivered courses for include UCL, the UK government (including the Ministry of Justice, Department for Education, Department for Levelling up, Housing and Communities), NHS West Midlands, the Egyptian Knowledge Bank, Barcelona Supercomputing Centre, and Fiocruz (Fundação Oswaldo Cruz).
  
  My courses have been attended by a wide range of people, from researchers and university students, to medical doctors and surgeons, to social scientists and anthropologists, to data scientists and economists. I have consistently received excellent feedback about my ability to explain complex ideas in simple terms, the inclusive nature of my courses which encourages active participation, and the detailed materials that I provide participants after all of my courses.
  
  My [research interests](/publications) lie in spatial data analysis, planetary health, Bayesian modelling approaches, and epidemiology. During my [PhD](https://doi.org/10.17037/PUBS.04670982), I used a combination of existing and novel spatial statistical modelling approaches to better understand the drivers of dengue re-emergence and expansion in Brazil. These models were informed by data from a range of epidemiological, demographic and climatic spatial datasets. I used R software to carry out these analyses and published [public online repositories](https://github.com/sophie-a-lee) alongside research papers containing detailed code to reproduce model results. 

  Outside of work, I love to travel and cook. On the weekends, you can usually find me tending to my little greenhouse, hiking up hills in the Peak District, or baking cakes and cookies."
