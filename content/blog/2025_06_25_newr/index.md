## Motivation
As a Statistical Programming Trainer, one of the most common questions I get asked is *where do I start??* 

More than that, where do I start and how do I find the motivation to keep going?

Many aspiring R users are excited to dive into R, dreaming of beautiful plots and elegant data wrangling…only to hit a wall. 

Maybe you get stuck on syntax, or maybe you find yourself crawling back to SAS, SPSS or Excel *just this once*. Before you know it, R becomes that thing you meant to learn.

But don’t give up just yet! As someone who’s been teaching R for nearly a decade, I’ve seen what works, and what doesn’t. 

If you are serious about learning R, here are my top 5 tips to help you stay on track and actually enjoy the journey.

## Tip 1. Practice, Practice, Practice!

It sounds obvious, but this is where most people stumble.

Learning R is a lot like learning a new language. If you switch back to your “mother tongue” (your comfort language) every time you hit a bump, you’ll never become fluent. 

Yes, your early scripts might be clunky. Yes, you might feel like a toddler trying to form sentences. But that’s exactly how you grow.

**Start small.** 

Pick tasks you’d normally do in another language or tool and commit to doing them in R. Not sure where to begin? Find a dataset that interests you and start to explore it using R

Great sources of datasets include:

- [The `datasets` package](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/articles/data.html)
- [The TidyTuesday project](https://dslc-io.github.io/tidytuesdayR/)
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

## Tip 2. Tap Into the R Community

One of R’s greatest strengths is its vibrant, generous community. Whether you’re stuck on a bug or looking for inspiration, there’s a wealth of free resources out there.

If you are not sure where to start looking, refer to popular forums, such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/collectives/r-language) or the [Posit Community](https://forum.posit.co/), discover popular R blogs on the [R-Bloggers website](https://www.r-bloggers.com/), or refer to this curated list of materials from [Nicola Rennie](https://nrennie.rbind.io/data-science-resources/).

**Don’t go it alone!** Someone out there has probably faced (and solved) the exact problem you’re dealing with.

## Tip 3. Develop Good Habits Early
Most of us start by hacking together code just to get the job done. But messy code becomes a nightmare when you revisit it weeks later.

Instead, aim to write scripts that are human-readable rather than simply computer-readable:

- Use sections (`Ctrl + Shift + R` in RStudio) to organize your workflow
- Add comments to explain your logic
- Stick to a consistent style, e.g. using the [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)
- Use descriptive variable names that make your code self-explanatory

Your future self (and anyone else reading your code) will thank you!

## Tip 4. Read Other People’s Code

One of the best ways to learn is by seeing how others solve problems. Whether it’s a colleague’s script or a stranger’s GitHub repo, studying real-world code can spark new ideas and reveal tricks you hadn’t considered.

A great place to start? Check out [submissions](https://bsky.app/hashtag/TidyTuesday) for the weekly Tidy Tuesday challenge for visualisation inspiration. 

## Tip 5. Use AI Tools Sparingly

Yes, AI tools like Copilot and ChatGPT can be helpful. But they’re not a substitute for understanding.

Over reliance on AI can lead to bad habits, insecure code, and a false sense of confidence. Use them as a last resort, not your first step and **always** double-check the output. **AI can (and does) make mistakes.**

Also worth noting: these tools come with environmental and ethical concerns, so use them mindfully.

## Final Thoughts

Learning R isn’t about finding shortcuts, it’s about building confidence through consistent practice, curiosity, and community. 

Stick with it, and you’ll be amazed at how far you can go.
