## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Research 
**January 2019 - December 2022: PhD in Spatio-temporal epidemiology**

*London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine*

- Developed and applied a novel statistical modelling framework that allows for the inclusion of multiple sources of spatial connectivity (for example, similarities between close observations and human movement) and quantifies the relative contribution of each source.
- Applied novel and existing spatial statistical models to epidemiological data to explore the drivers of dengue re-emergence and expansion in Brazil. Used a variety of Bayesian approaches to implement models, including integrated nested Laplace approximations, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, and empirical Bayesian approaches via generalised additive models.
- Developed a deep understanding of spatial and temporal statistical modelling approaches by conducting a systematic review of the field. Produced a training document as a technical appendix to this peer-reviewed publication aiming to explain these spatial models to non-statistical audiences.
- Obtained and cleaned epidemiological, environmental, and demographic data from various sources. Created detailed, annotated R script files to reproduce this process. 
- Created clear data visualisations, such as maps, tables and graphs, within R to explain complex statistical analysis to non-technical audiences. An example of annotated code used to produce these can be found in the publication list below. 
- Collaborated with colleagues in Brazil (based at Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, and Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo, Vítoria) to ensure the statistical analysis was relevant to public health requirements within Brazil and include their knowledge of the study area within the model framework.
- Former head of the Statistics Helpdesk which provides free statistical guidance to PhD students within LSHTM.

**September 2015 – December 2018: Teaching Fellow**

*Centre for Applied Statistics Courses, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, UCL*

- Provided statistical consultancy to clinicians based at Great Ormond Street Hospital and other departments within UCL.                

**September 2014 – September 2015: Statistician**

*Phastar, London*

- Researched missing data methods, particularly in relation to addiction studies. Provided guidance on how to improve clinical studies and compared different analysis methods.
- Reviewed statistical analysis plans and produced statistical output such as analytical tables for clinical trials.

**June 2014 – September 2014: MSc Dissertation**

*Lancaster University*
 
- Undertook a dissertation project Investigating Malaria Incidence in the Brazilian Amazon which aimed to model spatial and temporal variations in malaria incidence within the Brazilian Amazon. 
- Obtained and cleaned data from the Brazilian System of Epidemiologic Surveillance of Malaria (SIVEP-Malaria) and municipal health reports. 
- Compared a variety of  spatio-temporal statistical modelling approached and produced data visualisations to support the findings.
