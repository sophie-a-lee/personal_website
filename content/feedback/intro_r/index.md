"Everything was super useful for the work I am currently doing. The main thing that was useful was learning how to merge multiple data sheets together into one data file. I liked how interactive it was as well as it made it easier to fully understand the logic."

"Sophie Lee was extremely good, she went at a very good pace and was always happy to help. She explained things very well and made the course very easy to follow."

"Pretty much all of the things covered, I am able to apply to my work in some form or another. Was nice that we went through things from the tidyverse package, as I've seen this is quite common in code I've looked at from my department. I also thought the little tangents with extra tips and tricks were great - that's the benefit of being live on the course"

"Topics covered were very relevant. I like how the instructor took time and used datasets which are used in our line of work. Shows that the instructor cares about what she is teaching and was able to adapt the code accordingly."

""For virtual learning it was particularly engaging. The facilitator made us feel comfortable to ask questions and be involved. I'd have even welcome another couple of dates e.g. a further day the following week. Small group was beneficial too!"

"The facilitator was excellent. She was easy-going, approachable and made the content exciting with her enthusiasm. I'd look forward to another course in R if she were to facilitate"

"I felt that the range and relevance of the topics was great, everything covered seemed relevant to my role and I've learnt a variety of helpful hits/tips. The style was perfect for me, not too rushed or intense which I think could have been easy to do in this training. I said early on in the training that I hadn't used R in 8 years, and the training was pitched to my level, so I never felt confused or like I was struggling"

"The facilitator was brilliant, Sophie was very knowledgeable and made the training as interesting and engaging as possible."

- **February 2023. Social researcher, Department for Work and Pensions**

"Sophie was really helpful and a good teacher, she explained things well and checked in often to make sure we all understood"
