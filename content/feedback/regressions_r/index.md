"Really enjoyed the course, which is something I didn't think I would ever say about statistics. Originally signed up as I was trying to do multiple linear regression and there were certain aspects that I couldn't quite get my head around. The course was perfectly pitched for my level of previous understanding and covered exactly the sort of thing I was looking for (the practical example was essentially the same as my research but just with slightly different predictors - so ideal). The lecturer was excellent, explained things really well, engaged everyone in the room, and kept it interesting throughout. Days were just the right length and practical exercises and breaks were well spaced to stop people zoning out. Overall a massive help. Many thanks."

"I thought this course was perfect; I was worried I would get lost but it was pitched at the right level for me. The instructor was very clear and approachable, which made the course very interactive. Even with all the discussions she still managed to cover the whole set of notes and finished just in time. I can't help much with comments as I don't think it needs improvement really"

"Thought it was an excellent course, really helpful to have somethings I have had to teach myself from the internet explained by someone with an actual solid grounding in statistics. Also very useful to have some common misuses cleared up (e.g. use of multivariate when they mean multiple/multivariable and the simple regression to select predictors for a multiple regression model technique). Hard to speak for everyone but pitched at the perfect level for me."

"The course was really useful, it contained a lot, but wasn't overwhelming, and was set at a good level. also, The teaching was really good. I've done a few stats modules at university, but always found it went in one ear and out the other when it came to the lectures. This was pretty much the opposite of that."

"Sophie is excellent at explaining statistics at just the right level for my understanding. She repeats when needed and is ready to go over the concepts one-on-one. I have been on multiple courses and am always confident at the end of a course led by Sophie that I will have a better understanding of statistics."

"Sophie was an excellent teacher- very approachable and knowledgeable. I really felt I got my money's worth in terms of course content in that the course was intensive and the hours were utilised productively."

"The course more than lived up to my expectations. It was very well structured, allowing for enough time to both introduce basic concepts relating to regression, as well as going in-depth on the actual regressions and validity testing. The bubbly personality of the lecturer also keeps you engaged, which definitely aided to staying focused."

"Excellent, well done! It's great to be taught by someone who not only enjoys the content but also enjoys sharing her knowledge. And in a way that is comprehensible, which is a skill, really! "
