"The content was excellent for a beginner like me. The topics covered had the right depth and breadth, making complex statistical concepts accessible and relevant to my work. I found the balance between theory and practical application particularly helpful in understanding how to use statistics effectively in real-world situations."

"The style of the event was highly engaging and well-suited for beginners. The methods used, including hands-on exercises and real-world examples, made the material easy to understand and apply. The duration and pace were well-balanced, allowing sufficient time to grasp each concept without feeling rushed."

"I found learning about the PICO approach particularly interesting as I have worked on research questions before but have not known about this approach before. This will help me to structure these more effectively. I also thought the reminder on the different graphs to use for different variables was helpful...I thought that Sophie was a great teacher, she was clearly very knowledgeable and explained the points in detail and didn't go too fast, meaning I could take notes."
