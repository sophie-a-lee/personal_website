      <description>TL;DR: This week, I wanted to streamline the workflow of course development, making the most of Github&amp;rsquo;s capabilities. I found Github templates and pages make course initialisation and deployment super simple.&#xA;Motivation After some very exciting developments, I have four (!) sets of course materials to develop by the end of the year. As part of my goal to ensure all my course materials are accessible to anyone, regardless of their location or financial circumstances, I will be developing all my materials using Quarto and hosting them online for free.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: Last week, I set myself a goal to convert the slides accompanying the Statistical thinking short course into Quarto. I have listed the 7 most useful things I learned, including how to create custom themes (with variants), how to wrangle slide transitions with fragments, and using absolute positioning to make slide layouts super easy!&#xA;Motivation Recently I wrote about my experiences converting notes for the latest Statistical Thinking course into a Quarto book on my blog.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: Every time I use Quarto, I learn something new! I wanted to start documenting these findings in a blog so others know they exist. This week, I leaned some useful code chunk options and how to add dark mode to make materials more accessible.&#xA;Motivation Next week, I will be teaching the third edition of my Statistical Thinking course to the UK Ministry of Justice. The first edition was written using Google Docs due to tight deadlines (without needing to learn a new language!</description>

      <description>As someone that loves statistics and teaching, COTS (conference of teaching statistics) has always felt like my professional happy place. My first introduction to COTS was in 2016, as a newly-appointed Teaching Fellow, given the opportunity to present my work in Australia (and a chance to escape London winter? Sign me up!). I arrived at the OZCOTS conference in Canberra a little nervous and a lot jet lagged. I found a welcoming, inclusive community of like-minded people that loved teaching statistics and were committed to sharing the best ways to do this.</description>
