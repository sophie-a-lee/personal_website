      <title>Tachyons for Style</title>

      <description>Tachyons is a design system that allows you to design gorgeous interfaces in the browser with little effort. Because Speed Building this static site generator theme was the first time I used an Atomic (or Functional) CSS system like Tachyons. It&amp;rsquo;s a design system that provides very small (which means fast) CSS modules that you can use in your HTML. So, rather than writing every line of CSS, you apply the style you need as you write your HTML with easy to understand shorthand class names.</description>

      <description>“Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we&amp;rsquo;ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we&amp;rsquo;ve been making websites.” — Chris House, A Complete Guide to CSS Grid Layout 1&#xA;Since I began building websites in Y2K, I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count how many times the phrase &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;there&amp;rsquo;s got to be a better way to do this&amp;rdquo; has passed my lips. Most times, while fighting with floats and widths of content and sidebars or just basically trying to get something beside something else without using a stupid TABLE.</description>

      <title>Bayesian data analysis with R</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/courses/bayesian_stats/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:4321/courses/bayesian_stats/</guid>
      <description>Course level: Intermediate&#xA;Next live dates: TBC (Contact us to request training details).&#xA;Course description Throughout our lives, in everything we do, we will have some prior belief about what the result of an action will be, often based on previous experiences. For example, when I take the train to London, I expect to arrive around 20 minutes later than scheduled as UK trains are notoriously unreliable! Bayesian inference allows us to take account of our prior beliefs and incorporate them into our analysis using Bayes’ theorem.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:4321/courses/data_viz/</guid>
      <description>Course level: Foundation&#xA;Next live dates: TBC ( Contact us to request training details)&#xA;Course description Data visualisation is one of the most important steps in any analysis journey. Visualisations allow us to explore our data, identify errors and outliers, generate hypotheses about possible relationships between variables, and communicate results clearly and efficiently. ggplot2 is a powerful R package that was designed to create publication-quality graphics in seconds. The joy of ggplot2 is its flexibility: graphs are built in layers which can be easily customised, ensuring novel plots to fit almost any situation.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Generalised Additive Models with R</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/courses/generalised_additive_models/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/courses/generalised_additive_models/</guid>
      <description>Course level: Intermediate&#xA;Next live dates: TBC ( Contact us to request training details)&#xA;Course description Generalised additive models (GAMs) take regression to the next level, allowing a more flexible exploration of our data. Unlike generalised linear models, GAMs do not assume a linear relationship between the outcome and covariate(s). Using smoothing functions, we can explore nonlinear trends, such as the impact of temperature on barbecue food sales, or the relationship between income and happiness.</description>

      <description>Course level: Foundation&#xA;Next live dates: TBC Contact us to request training details.&#xA;Course description Regression analysis is one of the most widely used and powerful quantitative analysis methods used across almost every sector. Regression models were designed to investigate the relationship between an outcome of interest and a set of explanatory variables. These methods can then be used to make inferences about underlying relationships between variables, while accounting for confounding factors, and can be used to make predictions based on existing data.</description>

      <description>Course level: Foundation&#xA;Self-paced online course coming soon!&#xA;Course description Statistics is the science of data. This includes the collection and storage of data, the visualisation and analysis of samples of data, the interpretation of results, and the communication of these to a wider audience. In this course, participants will be introduced to the fundamental concepts of statistical analysis and the steps required to carry out valid, robust inferences on data.</description>

      <description>Course level: Intermediate&#xA;Next live dates: TBC Contact us to request training details&#xA;Course description Spatial data analysis allows us to go beyond traditional investigation of data, and uncover relationships and patterns based on where things are. This adds an extra layer of understanding of our data which can aid us when making inferences and predictions.&#xA;Spatial data analysis has a wide range of applications across many different sectors. For example, improving access to healthcare, increasing efficiency in transport networks, identifying areas of expansion in retail and hospitality, and developing approaches to environmental preservation.</description>
