      <description>Course level: Foundation&#xA;Next live dates: 24 - 26th September, 2024.&#xA;Course description R is a popular open-source programming language used by data scientists, statisticians, social &amp;amp; health researchers, and many more across a wide range of disciplines. R is particularly appealing to researchers as it is free to access, designed to encourage collaborative and reproducible data analysis, and is constantly evolving to include the latest research developments.&#xA;This two-day workshop is designed to equip PhD students, academics, and professional researchers across various disciplines with the essential skills to leverage the power of R and Tidyverse for their academic research.</description>

      <title>Spatial data analysis with R</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/courses/2_spatial_data_analysis/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/courses/2_spatial_data_analysis/</guid>
      <description>Course level: Intermediate&#xA;Next live dates: 16 - 19 December&#xA;Course description Spatial data analysis allows us to go beyond traditional investigation of data, and uncover relationships and patterns based on where things are. This adds an extra layer of understanding of our data which can aid us when making inferences and predictions.&#xA;Spatial data analysis has a wide range of applications across many different sectors. For example, improving access to healthcare, increasing efficiency in transport networks, identifying areas of expansion in retail and hospitality, and developing approaches to environmental preservation.</description>

      <title>Data visualisation with ggplot2</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/courses/3_data_viz/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:4321/courses/3_data_viz/</guid>
      <description>Course level: Foundation&#xA;Next live dates: 27 November&#xA;Course description Data visualisation is one of the most important steps in any analysis journey. Visualisations allow us to explore our data, identify errors and outliers, generate hypotheses about possible relationships between variables, and communicate results clearly and efficiently. ggplot2 is a powerful R package that was designed to create publication-quality graphics in seconds. The joy of ggplot2 is its flexibility: graphs are built in layers which can be easily customised, ensuring novel plots to fit almost any situation.</description>

      <description>Course level: Foundation&#xA;[Self-paced online course] ( https://equationsofdisease.com/courses/introduction-to-statistics/)&#xA;Course description Statistics is the science of data. This includes the collection and storage of data, the visualisation and analysis of samples of data, the interpretation of results, and the communication of these to a wider audience. In this course, participants will be introduced to the fundamental concepts of statistical analysis and the steps required to carry out valid, robust inferences on data.</description>

      <title>Generalised additive models with R</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/courses/6_generalised_additive_models/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/courses/6_generalised_additive_models/</guid>
      <description>Course level: Intermediate&#xA;Next live dates: 9 - 12 December&#xA;Course description Generalised additive models (GAMs) take regression to the next level, allowing a more flexible exploration of our data. Unlike generalised linear models, GAMs do not assume a linear relationship between the outcome and covariate(s). Using smoothing functions, we can explore nonlinear trends, such as the impact of temperature on barbecue food sales, or the relationship between income and happiness.</description>

      <title>Regression with R</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:4321/courses/7_regression_with_r/</guid>
      <description>Course level: Foundation&#xA;Next live dates: TBC Contact us to request training details.&#xA;Course description Regression analysis is one of the most widely used and powerful quantitative analysis methods used across almost every sector. Regression models were designed to investigate the relationship between an outcome of interest and a set of explanatory variables. These methods can then be used to make inferences about underlying relationships between variables, while accounting for confounding factors, and can be used to make predictions based on existing data.</description>

      <title>Bayesian statistics with R</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/courses/8_bayesian_stats/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:4321/courses/8_bayesian_stats/</guid>
      <description>Course level: Intermediate&#xA;Next live dates: TBC (Contact us to request training details).&#xA;Course description Throughout our lives, in everything we do, we will have some prior belief about what the result of an action will be, often based on previous experiences. For example, when I take the train to London, I expect to arrive around 20 minutes later than scheduled as UK trains are notoriously unreliable! Bayesian inference allows us to take account of our prior beliefs and incorporate them into our analysis using Bayesâ€™ theorem.</description>
