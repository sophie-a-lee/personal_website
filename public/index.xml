      <description>So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been leveraging GitHub Pages for publishing. This works great, but for blogdown we&amp;rsquo;ll start using Netlify. Let&amp;rsquo;s start RIGHT NOW with a site we&amp;rsquo;ve already built and published.&#xA;Pre-requisites Pick either your postcards site, or your distill site from day 01.

      <description>Welcome to the Introducing Yourself Online workshop! We look forward to meeting you. Before attending the workshop, please complete the following prework.&#xA;Set up RStudio Cloud Sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud/ before the workshop. I recommend logging in with an existing Google or GitHub account, if you have one (rather than creating a new account with another password you have to remember). I want you to be able to work from your own laptop in this workshop, but Cloud is an important back-up plan should you run into troubles.</description>

      <description>Rendering mathematical equations Examples from the mathjax demo. But they work with katex as well.&#xA;Rmarkdown In .Rmarkdown documents, you can use either&#xA;$a \ne 0$ to get inline math: \(a \ne 0\). There is no conflict with using dollar symbols regularly, because knitr automatically escapes freestanding dollar symbols.&#xA;And you can use&#xA;$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$ to get a math paragraph:&#xA;$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.</description>

      <description>Course level: Foundation&#xA;Next live dates: TBC ( Contact us to request training details)&#xA;Course description Data visualisation is one of the most important steps in any analysis journey. Visualisations allow us to explore our data, identify errors and outliers, generate hypotheses about possible relationships between variables, and communicate results clearly and efficiently. ggplot2 is a powerful R package that was designed to create publication-quality graphics in seconds. The joy of ggplot2 is its flexibility: graphs are built in layers which can be easily customised, ensuring novel plots to fit almost any situation.</description>

      <description>Course level: Foundation&#xA;Self-paced course available FREE here&#xA;Course description The aim of statistical analysis is often to make inferences about a target population of interest based on a random sample from it. Inferences such as these require inferential statistics.&#xA;This micro-course will introduce two of the most common inferential statistics: p-values and confidence intervals. Although these statistics are widely used across many disciplines, their interpretation can be tricky, which can lead to them being misrepresented.</description>

      <description>Course level: Intermediate&#xA;Next live dates: TBC ( Contact us to request training details)&#xA;Course description Generalised additive models (GAMs) take regression to the next level, allowing a more flexible exploration of our data. Unlike generalised linear models, GAMs do not assume a linear relationship between the outcome and covariate(s). Using smoothing functions, we can explore nonlinear trends, such as the impact of temperature on barbecue food sales, or the relationship between income and happiness.</description>

      <description>Course level: Foundation&#xA;Next live dates: TBC Contact us to request training details.&#xA;Course description Regression analysis is one of the most widely used and powerful quantitative analysis methods used across almost every sector. Regression models were designed to investigate the relationship between an outcome of interest and a set of explanatory variables. These methods can then be used to make inferences about underlying relationships between variables, while accounting for confounding factors, and can be used to make predictions based on existing data.</description>

      <description>Course level: foundation&#xA;Next live course dates: TBC Click here to request training details.&#xA;Course description Many people assume that statistics require complex analysis methods but often, the simplest approaches can be the most effective. This course focuses on the concept of statistically thinking, describing data and complex systems in relatively simple terms whilst acknowledging underlying uncertainty.&#xA;Statistical thinking is a necessary skill, not just in work but in our personal lives too.</description>

      <description>Course level: Intermediate&#xA;Next live dates: TBC Contact us to request training details&#xA;Course description Spatial data analysis allows us to go beyond traditional investigation of data, and uncover relationships and patterns based on where things are. This adds an extra layer of understanding of our data which can aid us when making inferences and predictions.&#xA;Spatial data analysis has a wide range of applications across many different sectors. For example, improving access to healthcare, increasing efficiency in transport networks, identifying areas of expansion in retail and hospitality, and developing approaches to environmental preservation.</description>
